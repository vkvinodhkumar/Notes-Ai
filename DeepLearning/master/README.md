# Awesome Deep Learning Resource — Artificial Neural Networks

`master` is the **framework-neutral ANN textbook and visual knowledge base**. It contains no framework-specific training implementation. Hands-on execution lives in exactly three independent branches:

- [`ann-mnist-manual`](https://github.com/Akilankm/awesome-deep-learning-resource/tree/ann-mnist-manual) — NumPy / first principles
- [`ann-mnist-pytorch`](https://github.com/Akilankm/awesome-deep-learning-resource/tree/ann-mnist-pytorch) — production-style PyTorch
- [`ann-mnist-tensorflow`](https://github.com/Akilankm/awesome-deep-learning-resource/tree/ann-mnist-tensorflow) — production-style TensorFlow / Keras

## Recommended learning sequence
Read the conceptual chapter, then run the matching notebook in one implementation branch. The three implementation branches use the same official MNIST problem and data split contract so differences reflect implementation, not different experiments.

## Static on GitHub, interactive after cloning
The implementation notebooks deliberately support two modes. GitHub keeps the executed notebook readable as a **static learning artifact** with explanations, code, metrics and persisted plots. After cloning into VS Code/Jupyter and running the notebook in its Conda environment, marked Plotly labs become interactive with hover, zoom, pan, 3D rotation, sliders, animation and point-level inspection.

See the [interactive learning guide](docs/20_interactive_learning.md) for the exact workflow and the notebooks that contain interactive labs.

## Final learning objective
Understand ANN as an end-to-end system: **data → representation → forward → loss → backprop → optimization → validation → test → inference → monitoring → retraining → business action**.
